## Project structure

- `/node_modules` - It contains the heaviest objects in the universe, npm stores the dependencies of our project in this directory.

- `/src` - It contains the source code of our project. User defined.

- `package.json` - It is a JSON file which contains the information about our project and the exact versions of the dependencies our project uses. It helps us to install the same version of the dependencies whenever we do `npm install`.

- `README.md` - This is what you're reading right now. More detailed information about the current repository and the project.

- `.gitignore` - It tells us what is untracked by git. It contains the files, directory names, or patterns which should be ignored by git. e.g. `/node_modules` (the heaviest objects in the universe :P)

- `.editorconfig` - It contains the configs to maintain the consistancy in the coding style across various IDEs. e.g. newline at the end, indent size, trailing whitespace etc.
